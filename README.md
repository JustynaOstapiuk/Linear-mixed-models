# Linear-mixed-models
The aim of the project was to compare two value estimation models
breeding. The first was the data-only model
pedigree - Animal Model, and the second was the pedigree data model and
genomic - Single Step Genomic Model. 1,000 breeding data was used in the project. The data included the number of individuals, ID
subjects, father ID, mother ID, and phenotypic trait
denoted by y.

Conclusions:
• The Single Step Genomic Model had the better
accuracy than the individual model.
• The breeding values took different values in both
models. In the model with pedigree data
the highest result was 5,069,692, and in the model
with pedigree and genomic data - 1998.6882.
• Both models contain outliers.
• The differences between the models were slight due to
for too few individuals used for the analysis - 1000
individuals.
• The model that used both proved to be the best
pedigree and genomic data.
